# Hand-Written Digit Recognition System

## Project Overview
This project is designed to recognize hand-written digits (0-9) from an input image. The system uses machine learning algorithms to predict the digit from the given hand-written image. It is a prototype for academic purposes, showcasing how image classification can be applied in the field of machine learning.

## System Requirements
- **Anaconda Environment** with Python 3.10 version
- **Required Libraries**: All dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Create a Conda environment** with Python 3.10:
    ```bash
    conda create --name handwritten-digit-recognition python=3.10
    ```

2. **Activate the Conda environment**:
    ```bash
    conda activate handwritten-digit-recognition
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the prediction script**:
    ```bash
    python prediction.py
    ```

    The script will allow you to input hand-written digit images for recognition and display the predicted digit.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for training the model is available on **Kaggle**. It contains images of hand-written digits from 0 to 9, allowing the model to learn the patterns of hand-written numbers and make accurate predictions.

- **Dataset source**: The dataset is available on Kaggle (no direct link provided).

## Credits

- **Dataset**: The dataset for training the model is sourced from Kaggle.
- This project was developed for academic purposes to demonstrate digit recognition using machine learning techniques.
